2. **Unzip the Archive**

    Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to your desired location, then open the Chrome browser.

3. **Access Chrome Extensions**

### 👟 Initializing the Application

1. **Visit the Options Page**

    Open the extension's options page.

    > **Note:** The extension identifier in the URL (`https://<EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/`) may differ based on the location of the unpacked extension. Please replace it accordingly.

    Now, there are two methods for initializing the application:

    ![RSFC Access Token](/docs/images/rsfc-access-token.png)

    1. **Using a Test Token (Recommended)**

        The simplest and recommended way is to use a test token that never expires. Click on **Create test token** in the app settings in Raindrop, then copy and paste it (no need to click **Register**) into the extension settings' **Access Token** field.

    2. **Registering as an OAuth App**

        Alternatively, you can register the extension as an OAuth app using a client ID and client secret. Copy and paste each value into the settings and click **Register** to authorize the application.

    To run sync manually, go to **Bookmarks** tab and click **Fetch**. Once data is fetched, click **Synchronize**.

    > **Note:** Manual sync is internal debugging utility. Later it will be rewritten.
